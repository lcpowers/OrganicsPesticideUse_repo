# Packages
```{r packages}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(sp)
library(gstat)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rspatial)
```


####
## 1) Read in and prepare input soil data
```{r soil_data}
# Read in original soil shapefile
soil_sf = read_sf("../R_input/spatial/KernSoilDataBasin/KernSoilData_QGISreproj.shp")

# Read in soil raster, rasterized version of original soil data
soil_ras = raster("../R_output/spatial/SoilRaster/soil_ras.tif")

# Crop to soil_sf (these were very slightly different on the eatern boundary)
soil_ras = raster::crop(soil_ras, extent(soil_sf))

# Plot to check
# plot(soil_ras)

# Generate dataframe of points from the raster, which will be used as observed points in IDW
soil_points = as.data.frame(rasterToPoints(x = soil_ras))

# Assign corrdinates to soil points
coordinates(soil_points) <- ~ x + y

# Define CRS of soil points
crs(soil_points) <- crs(soil_sf)
```

## 2) Create IDW grid template
```{r create_IDW_grid}
# Length (in cells) of x- and y-axes of template grid. Creating grid that is ~270 m resolution. Higher resolution --> extremely long processing time with minimal gains in accuracy
x_len = (xmax(soil_points) - xmin(soil_points))/269.5
y_len = (ymax(soil_points) - ymin(soil_points))/269.5

# To get 270m raster
xnew = seq(xmin(soil_points),xmax(soil_points),length = x_len)
ynew = seq(ymin(soil_points),ymax(soil_points),length = y_len)

# Create grid
Grid = expand.grid(xnew,ynew)
colnames(Grid) <- c("xnew","ynew")
coordinates(Grid) <- ~ xnew + ynew
gridded(Grid) <- T
fullgrid(Grid) <- T

# Check grid 
class(Grid)
res(raster(Grid))
# plot(Grid)

# Define projection
proj4string(Grid) <- proj4string(soil_points)
```

## 3) Perform IDW
```{r perform_IDW}
### IDW
timestamp()
P.idw = gstat::idw(formula = soil_ras ~ 1, locations = soil_points, newdata = Grid, idp = 2, nmax = 50)
r = raster(P.idw)

r_mask <- mask(r,soil_sf)
writeRaster(r_mask,"../R_output/spatial/SoilRaster/soil_ras_IDW.tif", overwrite = T)


timestamp()
```

## 4) Cross-validate results using Leave One Out Cross validation
```{r LOOcrossvalidation}
### Cross validation 
cv_length = 500

### Generate random sample of 500 points
random_sample = sample(x = 1:length(soil_points),size = cv_length, replace = F)

### Initialize dataframe to store CV results
IDW.out <- vector(length = cv_length)


for (i in 1:length(random_sample)) {
  
  IDW.out[i] <- idw(soil_ras ~ 1, soil_points[-(random_sample[i]),], soil_points[random_sample[i],], idp=2)$var1.pred
  
  }

timestamp()

```
